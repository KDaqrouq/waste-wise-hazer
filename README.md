# Waste Wise Hazer - AI-Powered Food Waste Detection System

A comprehensive food waste detection system that uses computer vision and machine learning to identify and count different types of fruits and vegetables in images. The system includes both a **mock enterprise dashboard** for demonstration purposes and a **fully functional food detection engine** with real AI processing.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ **Real Food Detection System** (Fully Functional)
- **AI-Powered Detection**: YOLOv8-based object detection trained on fruit/vegetable datasets
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant image processing with bounding boxes and confidence scores
- **Multi-Input Support**: File upload, drag-and-drop, and live camera capture
- **Automatic Classification**: 11 food categories (apple, tangerine, pear, watermelon, durian, lemon, grape, pineapple, dragon fruit, korean melon, cantaloupe)
- **Live Camera Integration**: Direct webcam access with automatic image capture and processing
- **File Management**: Organized storage with dedicated folders for uploads and camera captures
- **Backend API**: Flask server with RESTful endpoints for image processing

### 🎭 **Mock Enterprise Dashboard** (Demonstration Only)
- **UAE Network Map**: Simulated map view of 12+ locations across 5 Emirates (mock data)
- **Interactive Pins**: Color-coded locations (green=low, yellow=medium, red=high waste)
- **Government Badges**: UAE National Food Security Strategy 2051, Ne'ma Initiative, UN SDGs
- **Analytics Charts**: Mock waste data with red-highlighted high-waste categories
- **Alert System**: Simulated notifications to food banks, delivery partners, and kitchens
- **Impact Screens**: Mock calculations showing kg saved and AED cost savings
- **Network Statistics**: Simulated real-time monitoring data

## 🔍 **What's Real vs Mock**

### **Real Components** (Actual AI Processing):
- ✅ Food Detection Page - Real YOLOv8 model processing

MODEL_PATH = 'models/best.pt'  # Path to your trained model
```

### Class Names
Modify the class names in `backend/app.py` to match your training data:
```python
CLASS_NAMES = [
    "Apple", "Orange", "Banana", "Grape", "Strawberry",
    "Peach", "Pear", "Kiwi", "Pineapple", "Mango"

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)
```

## 📊 Training Your Own Model

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- Use Roboflow for easy dataset management
- Or manually organize in Pascal VOC/COCO format
- Ensure proper labeling with bounding boxes

### 2. Training Configuration
```python
model.train(
    data="datasets/fruit-object-detection/data.yaml",
    epochs=50,
    imgsz=640,
    batch=16,
    patience=10
)
```

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Check training metrics in `runs/detect/fruit-detection/`
- Validate on test set
- Adjust hyperparameters as needed

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model not loading**
   - Check if `models/best.pt` exists
   - Verify model file integrity
   - Check Python dependencies

2. **CUDA/GPU issues**
   - Install PyTorch with CUDA support
   - Or use CPU-only version for testing

3. **Frontend can't connect to backend**
   - Ensure backend is running on port 5000
   - Check CORS settings
   - Verify network connectivity

4. **Image upload fails**
   - Check file size limits
   - Verify image format (JPEG, PNG)
   - Check backend logs for errors

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in the backend:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```
